Acrobatics	Flying	Agility	55	20	0	Acrobatics deals damage, however, if the user is not holding an item, its power doubles to 110. If the user is holding a Flying Gem, it is consumed before the Pokémon attacks, so it receives both boosts and increases Acrobatics' power to 145. Once the Gem is consumed Acrobatics' power for the rest of the battle will be 110.	15	Yes	20	Single Pokémon within move range	6	The user nimbly strikes the target. If the user is not holding an item, this attack inflicts massive damage.	OK	
Acupressure	Normal	Status			0	Acupressure raises a random stat - 1) Attack, 2) Defense, 3) Speed, 4) Special Attack, 5) Special Defense, or 6) Evasion - by two stages. Roll 1d6 to determine the stat. Acupressure is unlike other status moves in that it can be targeted at itself or an adjacent teammate. It cannot be used on an ally if they are behind a Substitute, but the user can apply Acupressure to itself if behind a Substitute.	30	No	52	Self or adjacent ally Pokémon	5	The user applies pressure to stress points, sharply boosting one of its or its allies’ stats.	OK	Removed chance to buff Accuracy so it would fit neatly on a d6
Aerial Ace	Flying	Agility	60	∞	0	Aerial Ace deals damage and ignores changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats. However, it will not hit Pokémon during the invulnerable stage of Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force or Sky Drop.	20	Yes	14	Single Pokémon within move range	24	The user confounds the target with speed, then slashes. This attack never misses.	OK	Changed to Agility attack

Priority moves such as Quick Attack cannot be triggered in between the two turns.	15	No	12	Single Pokémon within view	18	The user helps the target and makes it use its move right after the user.	OK	Reinterpreted due to turn order rules. Potentially overpowered?
Agility	Psychic	Status			0	Agility raises the user's Speed by two stages	30	No	25	Self	83	The user relaxes and lightens its body to move faster. This sharply raises the Speed stat.	OK	
Air Cutter	Flying	Special	60	19	0	Air Cutter deals damage and uses critical dice.

Critical hits land more easily.	OK

Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.	15	No	35	Single Pokémon within 10m	39	The user attacks with a blade of air that slices even the sky. This may also make the target flinch.	OK	
Ally Switch	Psychic	Status			2	Ally Switch swaps the positions of the user with a teammate. If that teammate was trapped by an opponent using Bind, Wrap, Block, etc., the user is now trapped in that same manner. The user cannot switch with allies in the first phase of Fly, Dig, Dive, Bounce, Shadow Force, or Sky Drop unless the user also knows the corresponding Move.	15	No	24	Ally Pokémon within view	9	The user teleports using a strange power and switches places with one of its allies.	OK	Reinterpreted the switch based on movement rules
Amnesia	Psychic	Status			0	Amnesia raises the user's Special Defense by two stages.	20	No	32	Self	41	The user temporarily empties its mind to forget its concerns. This sharply raises the user’s Sp. Def stat.	OK	
Anchor Shot	Steel	Physical	80	20	0	The user entangles the target with its anchor chain while attacking. The target becomes unable to move. Entanglement is treated as a normal Status Effect.	20	Yes	52	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user entangles the target with its anchor chain while attacking. The target becomes unable to flee.	OK	
Ancient Power	Rock	Special	60	20	0	Ancient Power deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of raising all the user's stats at once - Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed - by one stage each.	5	Yes	16	Single adjacent Pokémon	74	The user attacks with a prehistoric power. This may also raise all the user’s stats at once.	OK

Lowers target's Special Defense by one stage (100% chance)	10	No	28	Single Pokémon within 10m	1	The user attacks the target with an acidic liquid created from tart apples.

Aqua Ring	Water	Status			0	The user of Aqua Ring surrounds itself with a veil of water, which restores 10% of its maximum HP at the end of each turn (including this one) for 5 turns.	20	No	32	Self	20	The user envelops itself in a veil made of water. It regains some HP every turn.	OK	does the healing take effect on first turn?
Aqua Tail	Water	Physical	90	18	0	Aqua Tail deals damage with no additional effect.	10	Yes	30	Single adjacent Pokémon	28	The user attacks by swinging its tail as if it were a vicious wave in a raging storm.	OK	
Arm Thrust	Fighting	Physical	15	20	0	Arm Thrust hits 1d4+1 times per turn used. See rules on "Multi-Hit Moves" for details.	20	Yes	4	One or more adjacent Pokémon	2	The user lets loose a flurry of open-palmed arm thrusts that hit two to five times in a row.	OK	Reinterpreted rules for this and all other multi-hit attacks so that they can target multiple foes and the number of hits is determined at the start. This setup still potentially requires the user to roll Accuracy on each hit which might be annoying.
Aromatherapy	Grass	Status			0	Cures all status problems in your party, including stat decreases and Accuracy debuffs. Temporary type changes (such as Forest's Curse) and effects being actively maintained by another Pokémon (such as Bind or Telekinesis) are not changed. This Move may only be used once per battle.	5	No	25	All ally Pokémon within 10m	33	The user releases a soothing scent that heals all status conditions affecting the user’s party.	OK	Original move wasn't clear on what statuses it cured, so added more details for that. Restricted to once per battle for balance.

Once the move is chosen it cannot be canceled unless it is physically impossible to perform in the current context (e.g. Attract being used by a genderless Pokémon). 	20	No	20	Move-dependent	5	Assist uses a random move known by any of the user's party Pokémon.	OK	Not sure of the specific mechanics for choosing a move
Assurance	Dark	Physical	60	20	0	Assurance deals damage, and if the target has already taken damage since their last turn, its power doubles to 120.	10	Yes	16	Single adjacent Pokémon	33	If the target has already taken some damage in the same turn, this attack’s power is doubled.	OK	
Astonish	Ghost	Physical	30	20	0	Astonish deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of causing the target to flinch. Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.	15	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	85	The user attacks the target while shouting in a startling fashion. This may also make the target flinch.	OK

Critical hits land more easily.	OK	
Attract	Normal	Status			0	Attract causes Pokémon of the opposite gender to become infatuated. Infatuated Pokémon have a 50% chance of being immobilized by love each turn and unable to attack. Attract will fail on Pokémon of the same gender, genderless Pokémon and those with the ability Oblivious. This Move cannot be used by genderless Pokémon.	15	No	18	Single Pokémon within view	10	If it is the opposite gender of the user, the target becomes infatuated and less likely to attack.	OK	
Aura Sphere	Fighting	Special	80	∞	0	Aura Sphere deals damage and ignores changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats. However, it will not hit Pokémon during the invulnerable stage of Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force or Sky Drop.	20	No	45	Single adjacent Pokémon	13	The user lets loose a blast of aura power from deep within its body at the target. This attack never misses.	OK	
Aura Wheel	Electric	Agility	110	20	0	Aura Wheel is the signature move of Morpeko. It deals damage, but changes to Dark type when Morpeko is in Hangry Mode.	10	No	55	All ally Pokémon within 10m	1	Morpeko attacks and raises its Speed with the energy stored in its cheeks. This move’s type changes depending on the user’s form.	OK	Changed to Agility attack
Aurora Beam	Ice	Special	65	20	0	Aurora Beam deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of lowering the target's Attack by one stage.	20	No	24	1m x 20m line originating from the user	17	The target is hit with a rainbow-colored beam. This may also lower the target’s Attack stat.	OK	Changed to a line AOE attack
Aurora Veil	Ice	Status			0	Aurora Veil halves damage from Physical and Special attacks for five turns. The reduction applies to the final damage roll and is rounded down. This move can only be used in a hailstorm.	20	No	36	All ally Pokémon within the hailstorm	7	This move reduces damage from physical and special moves for five turns. This can be used only in a hailstorm.	OK	
Autotomize	Steel	Status			0	Autotomize raises the user's Speed by two stages but lowers its Defense by one stage.	15	No	20	Self	17	The user sheds part of its body to make itself lighter and sharply raise its Speed stat.	OK?	Removed weight change mechanic
Avalanche	Ice	Physical	150	20	-4	A torrent of snow and ice falls down on the targeted area. This Move does not land until the beginning of the user's next turn. Those hit by the Avalanche are buried and must use their next move action to escape. 	5	No	40	5m diameter circle within 10m	10	A torrent of snow and ice builds up and then falls upon the targeted area.	OK	Makes more narrative sense as an AOE attack. Since movement and turn order rules make it easily dodged, replaced the conditional power boost with a constant high power. Also added "buried" status effect afterwards.
Baby-Doll Eyes	Fairy	Status			1	Baby-Doll Eyes lowers the target's Attack by one stage, with increased priority.	30	No	15	Single Pokémon within view	28	The user stares at the target with its baby-doll eyes, which lowers the target’s Attack stat. This move always goes first.	OK	
Baneful Bunker	Poison	Status			4	Baneful Bunker prevents any attacks targeted at the user from striking, until the beginning of the user's next turn. If a contact move is targeted at the Baneful Bunker user on that turn, the attacker becomes poisoned. It has priority +4 so will activate before most other moves. Poison or Steel type Pokémon, those with the ability Immunity or those behind a Substitute cannot be poisoned. The effects do not stack with the Rocky Helmet item or the Rough Skin or Iron Barbs abilities. The accuracy of Baneful Bunker drops by one level each time it is used consecutively after itself or Protect, Detect, Endure, Wide Guard, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, or King's Shield.	10	No	1	Self	1	In addition to protecting the user from attacks, this move also poisons any attacker that makes direct contact.	OK	
Barrage	Normal	Physical	15	17	0	Barrage hits 1d4+1 times per turn used. See rules on "Multi-Hit Moves" for details.	20	No	1	One or more Pokémon within 10m	3	Round objects are hurled at the target to strike two to five times in a row.	OK	
Barrier	Psychic	Status			0	Barrier raises the user's Defense by two stages.	20	No	28	Self	8	The user throws up a sturdy wall that sharply raises its Defense stat.	OK	
Baton Pass	Normal	Status			0	Baton Pass transfers all status effects from one target to another. Targets must either be two allies, or one ally and the user. Existing effects on the destination Pokémon remain in place, but transferred effects are removed from the source Pokémon. These effects are passed: - Increases and decreases in Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed. For example the effects from Nasty Plot, Swords Dance and Screech (if targeted at the source Pokémon). - The sure hit effect from Lock-On and Mind Reader. In other words, after using either move on the source Pokémon followed by Baton Pass, the next move from the destination Pokémon will always hit. - The confusion status ailment. - A Substitute, which keeps its remaining HP. - Movement-inhibiting effects from Mean Look and Spider Web. - Critical hit ratio increase from the move Focus Energy or a Lansat Berry. - The HP-restoring effects of Aqua Ring and Ingrain. - The effects of the moves Embargo, Gastro Acid, Magnet Rise, Perish Song and Power Trick.	40	No	1	Any two ally Pokémon within view, including self	27	The user switches places with a party Pokémon in waiting and passes along any stat changes.	OK	Tricky tricky... It would be overpowered if you could pass to foes, so limited to allies only. Added the option to pass between unrelated allies. Is that unreasonable?
Beak Blast	Flying	Physical	100	20	-3	The user first heats up its beak, and then it attacks the target at the beginning of the user's next turn. Making direct contact with the Pokémon while it's heating up its beak results in a burn.	15	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	1	The user first heats up its beak, and then it attacks the target. Making direct contact with the Pokémon while it’s heating up its beak results in a burn.	OK	
Beat Up	Dark	Physical	20	20	0	Beat Up gains +40 power for every ally Pokémon within 5m of the user that is not Fainted, has free movement, is not actively engaged in another attack, and is not affected by a status effect such as Sleep or Paralysis.	10	No	12	Single adjacent Pokémon	9	The user gets all party Pokémon to attack the target. The more party Pokémon, the greater the number of attacks.	OK?	Original move had every nearby Pokémon do their own attack roll, but that seems like too many rolls with too many stats. So just changed the group buff to a flat +2 each. Nobody makes contact with the target so that makes things a bit easier
Belch	Poison	Special	120	18	0	Belch deals damage, but only works if the user has previously consumed a Berry during the battle.	10	No	40	Single Pokémon within 10m	18	The user lets out a damaging belch at the target.	OK	
Belly Drum	Normal	Status			0	User loses 50% of its max HP, but Attack raises to maximum (+6 levels)	10	No	38	Self	15	The user maximizes its Attack stat in exchange for HP equal to half its max HP.	OK	
Bestow	Normal	Status			0	Bestow gives the user's held item to the target. It will not work if the target is already holding an item or is behind a Substitute. Pokémon with the ability Sticky Hold cannot give away their held item. The Griseous Orb cannot be removed from Giratina; Type Plates cannot be removed from Arceus; Drives cannot be removed from Genesect; and Mega Stones cannot be removed from their respective Pokémon.	15	No	25	Single adjacent Pokémon	11	The user passes its held item to the target when the target isn’t holding an item.	OK	
Bide	Normal	Physical	-	∞	1	The user of Bide stores energy for 2 turns. At the end of the 2nd turn, the Pokémon unleashes energy, dealing twice the HP damage it received. The turn which Bide is used is turn 0. The next full turn is turn 1. The end of the next full turn (turn 2) is the actual attack. Bide deals fixed, typeless damage, so will hit Ghost-type Pokémon. It also ignores range, changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats, and can hit Pokémon in the invulnerable stage of Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force or Sky Drop. Bide always hits the last Pokémon to attack the user (including teammates). If no damage was received, the attack fails and the user's turn ends. This move has priority, meaning it can be used proactively before the user's normal turn, in which case their regular "movement-only" turn is exhausted. Pokémon cannot use normal movement while charging energy. A Pokémon using Bide while suffering from a status effect will still apply those effects during all turns, but Paralysis and Confusion will not cancel the attack except on the final turn. The user may cancel Bide during turn 1, but no attack will happen.	10	Yes	8	Self	57	The user endures attacks for two turns, then strikes back to cause double the damage taken.	OK	Had to clarify a lot of things related to status effects that I either guessed from the games or inferred from tabletop rules. There's probably still some edge cases. The rules say Paralyze and Confuse will cancel moves in progress but this is a somewhat of an exception
Bind	Normal	Physical	40	17	0	Bind inflicts damage immediately and then traps the opponent. See rules on "Trap Moves" for details.	20	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	23	Things such as long bodies or tentacles are used to bind and squeeze the target for four to five turns.	OK	Changed the rules to make binding moves not so cheap. The victim can attempt to break free, and can also still use Moves while bound.
Bite	Dark	Physical	60	20	0	Bite deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of causing the target to flinch. Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.	25	Yes	12	Single adjacent Pokémon	134	The target is bitten with viciously sharp fangs. This may also make the target flinch.	OK	
Blast Burn	Fire	Special	150	18	0	User loses their next turn due to recharge.	5	No	65	5m diameter circle within 20m	0	The target is razed by a fiery explosion. The user can’t move on the next turn.	OK	
Blaze Kick	Fire	Physical	85	18	0	Blaze Kick deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of burning the target. It also uses critical dice. Fire type Pokémon, those with the ability Water Veil or those behind a Substitute cannot be burned. Pokémon with the abilities Battle Armor or Shell Armor, or those under the effects of Lucky Chant, are protected against critical hits.	10	Yes	42	Single adjacent Pokémon	3	The user launches a kick that lands a critical hit more easily. This may also leave the target with a burn.	OK	
Blizzard	Ice	Special	110	14	0	Blizzard deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of freezing each target. It will affect all Pokémon caught within its radius. Ice type Pokémon, those with the ability Magma Armor or those behind a Substitute cannot be frozen. During a hailstorm, Blizzard ignores accuracy.	5	No	52	15m diameter circle within 30m	39	A howling blizzard is summoned to strike opposing Pokémon. This may also leave the opposing Pokémon frozen.	OK	
Block	Normal	Status			0	As long as the user and their target are adjacent to each other, if the target attempts to move they are automatically hit by the user with a Normal-type attack with base power 60, after which the movement is allowed. Moves which incorporate their own movement such as Dig, Teleport, Bounce, and Fly can bypass the block without harm.	5	No	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	10	The user blocks the target’s way with arms spread wide to prevent escape.	OK?	Basically "you get an opportunity attack on your target if they move away"
Blue Flare	Fire	Special	130	17	0	Blue Flare deals damage and has a 20% chance (a d20 rolls 17 or higher) of burning the target. Fire type Pokémon, those with the ability Water Veil or those behind a Substitute cannot be burned. This Move may only be used once per battle.	5	No	88	Single Pokémon within 20m	1	The user attacks by engulfing the target in an intense, yet beautiful, blue flame. This may also leave the target with a burn.	OK	
Body Press	Fighting	Physical	80	20	0	The user's Defense stat dictates attack power, rather than their Attack stat.	10	Yes	42	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user attacks by slamming its body into the target. The higher the user’s Defense, the more damage it can inflict on the target.	OK	
Body Slam	Normal	Physical	85	20	0	Body Slam deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of paralyzing the target. Electric type Pokémon, those with the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute cannot be paralyzed. If the target has used Minimize, Body Slam ignores accuracy and deals double damage (after the attack role resolves).	15	Yes	32	Single adjacent Pokémon	40	The user drops onto the target with its full body weight. This may also leave the target with paralysis.	OK	
Bolt Beak	Electric	Physical	85	20	0	If the target did not deal damage in their previous turn, the power of this move is doubled.	10	Yes	63	Single adjacent Pokémon	2	The user stabs the target with its electrified beak. If the user attacks before the target, the power of this move is doubled.	OK?	Changed "if this move goes first" behavior to "punish targets that haven't dealt damage". I get the feeling this move is overpowered in general, so it should be rarely seen...
Bolt Strike	Electric	Physical	130	17	0	Bolt Strike deals damage and has a 20% chance (a d20 rolls 17 or higher) of paralyzing the target. Electric type Pokémon, those with the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute cannot be paralyzed. This Move may only be used once per battle.	5	Yes	88	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user surrounds itself with a great amount of electricity and charges its target. This may also leave the target with paralysis.	OK	
Bone Club	Ground	Physical	65	17	0	Bone Club deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of causing the target to flinch. Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.	20	No	7	Single adjacent Pokémon	5	The user clubs the target with a bone. This may also make the target flinch.	OK	
Bone Rush	Ground	Physical	25	18	0	Bone Rush hits 1d4+1 times per turn used. See rules on "Multi-Hit Moves" for details.	10	No	31	One or more adjacent Pokémon	5	The user strikes the target with a hard bone two to five times in a row.	OK	
Bonemerang	Ground	Physical	50	18	0	Bonemerang deals damage and will strike twice (with 50 base power each time). Each strike of Bonemerang is treated like a separate attack. See rules on "Multi-Hit Moves" for more details.	10	No	48	One or two Pokémon within 10m	3	The user throws the bone it holds. The bone loops around to hit the target twice—coming and going.	OK

Bounce	Flying	Physical	85	17	0	The user of Bounce will spring up on the first turn, disappearing from view and becoming invulnerable to most attacks. At the end of the second turn, Bounce deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of paralyzing the target. The user also moves adjacent to the target. While in the air, the Pokémon can only be hit by the moves Gust, Twister, Thunder, Sky Uppercut and Smack Down, with Gust and Twister dealing twice normal damage. Moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move can also hit for regular power. Electric type Pokémon, those with the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute cannot be paralyzed. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Bounce executes in one turn.	5	Yes	33	Single Pokémon within move distance	26	The user bounces up high, then drops on the target on the second turn. This may also leave the target with paralysis.	OK	Mostly copied from Fly
Branch Poke	Grass	Physical	40	20	0	The user attacks the target by poking it with a sharply pointed branch.	40	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	5	The user attacks the target by poking it with a sharply pointed branch.	OK	
Brave Bird	Flying	Physical	120	20	0	Brave Bird deals damage, but the user receives one-third of the damage it inflicted in recoil. In other words, if the attack does 90 HP damage to the opponent, the user will lose 30 HP.	15	Yes	65	Single adjacent Pokémon	17	The user tucks in its wings and charges from a low altitude. This also damages the user quite a lot.	OK	Doing 1/3 might be difficult without a calculator
Breaking Swipe	Dragon	Physical	60	20	0	Hits multiple opponents and lowers their Attack by one level (100% chance).	15	Yes	24	All adjacent opponent Pokémon	1	The user swings its tough tail wildly and attacks opposing Pokémon. This also lowers their Attack stats.	OK	Reinterpreted targeting slightly

This may also lower their Speed stat.	OK	"I cast Cone of Bubbles"
Bubble Beam	Water	Special	65	20	0	Bubble Beam deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of lowering the target's Speed by one stage.	20	No	20	Single Pokémon within 10m	36	A spray of bubbles is forcefully ejected at the target. This may also lower the target’s Speed stat.	OK	
Bug Bite	Bug	Agility	60	20	0	Bug Bite deals damage, and if the target is holding a Berry, the user eats it and gains its effect.

OK	Type is up to interpretation a bit, but I really like this move so I want to make it viable. Added evasion increase while camouflaged
Captivate	Normal	Status			0	Captivate lowers the Special Attack of each target by two stages, if they are of the opposite gender to the user. Captivate will fail if both Pokémon are the same gender, either Pokémon is genderless, or the target has the ability Oblivious.	20	No	39	All enemy Pokémon within view	36	If any opposing Pokémon is the opposite gender of the user, it is charmed, which harshly lowers its Sp.

Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo or those behind a Substitute cannot be confused.	20	No	21	Single Pokémon within 10m	2	The user attacks the target with sound waves of deafening chatter. This confuses the target.	OK	
Chip Away	Normal	Physical	70	20	0	Chip Away deals damage, but ignores changes to the target's stats (i.e. Defense and Evasion in this case). Note this does not include the effects of screens like Reflect as they are different to regular stat boosts.	20	Yes	25	Single adjacent Pokémon	29	Looking for an opening, the user strikes consistently. The target’s stat changes don’t affect this attack’s damage.	OK	
Circle Throw	Fighting	Physical	60	18	-1	The user grabs the target and spins them in a circle. At the beginning of the user's next turn, they throw the target to a space up to 20m away within view and inflict damage. The target may also suffer additional damage at the GM's discretion. Grabbed Pokémon lose their regular movement, but they can still use Moves during their turn. This Move cannot be used against opponents who are Rooted. Opponents who are raised using Levitate or similar effects do not suffer damage from the throw.	10	Yes	12	Single adjacent Pokémon	4	The target is spun in a circle and thrown far away.	OK?	Changed the "swap out" mechanic with a forced movement one. I am basing this one kind of on Sky Drop with the grab mechanic. Since this move could potentially also throw the target into lava or whatever, I added the possibility of extra damage.
Clamp	Water	Physical	35	17	0	Clamp inflicts damage immediately and then traps the opponent. See rules on "Trap Moves" for details.	15	Yes	25	Single adjacent Pokémon	4	The target is clamped and squeezed by the user’s very thick and sturdy shell for four to five turns.	OK

This also lowers the user’s Defense and Sp. Def stats.	OK	I considered making this once-per-battle since it has PP of 5, but I think the debuff balances it out enough.

Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo or those behind a Substitute cannot be confused.	25	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	74	The target is hit by a weak telekinetic force. This may also confuse the target.	OK	
Constrict	Normal	Physical	10	20	0	Constrict deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or 20) of lowering the target's Speed by one stage.	35	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	19	The target is attacked with long, creeping tentacles, vines, or the like.

Conversion 2	Normal	Status			0	Conversion 2 changes the user's type to one that is resistant (or immune) to the last move used by the target, randomly. For example, if the target last used a Fighting type move, Conversion 2 would change the user's type to one of Poison, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Ghost or Fairy at random.	30	No	25	Single Pokémon within view	3	The user changes its type to make itself resistant to the type of the attack the target used last.	OK	Need to clarify how the random selection is done
Copycat	Normal	Status			0	The user mimics the Move used immediately before it. The Move fails if no other Move has been used yet.        	20	No	1	Self	33	The user mimics the move used immediately before it. The move fails if no other move has been used yet.	OK	
Core Enforcer	Dragon	Special	100	20	0	If any Pokémon struck by this attack have previously attacked the user, this move eliminates the effect of the target's Ability for the duration of the battle.	10	No	1	All enemy Pokémon within 20m	1	If the Pokémon the user has inflicted damage on have already used their moves, this move eliminates the effect of the target’s Ability.	OK	The original description of this one is vague, so I reinterpreted it as a "revenge" mechanic

Covet	Normal	Physical	60	20	0	Covet deals damage and steals the target's held item, if the user is not holding an item. If the item would activate on attack (e.g. Focus Band), it does so before being stolen. If the item is consumable on attack (e.g. Focus Sash) then the item is consumed as normal and cannot be stolen. Pokémon with the ability Sticky Hold cannot have their held item removed. The Griseous Orb cannot be removed from Giratina; Type Plates cannot be removed from Arceus; Drives cannot be removed from Genesect; and Mega Stones cannot be removed from their respective Pokémon.	25	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	25	The user endearingly approaches the target, then steals the target’s held item.

The more HP the target has left, the greater this move’s power.	OK?	It's simplest to just use the straight HP value for power but I haven't tested out how balanced that is.
Curse	Ghost	Status			0	Curse is a unique move that works differently for Ghost-type Pokémon than other Pokémon. Ghost-type Pokémon use 50% of their current HP to lower the target's current HP by 50%. For all other Pokémon, Curse raises the user's Attack and Defense by one stage each and lowers Speed by one stage.	10	No	30	Single Pokémon within view	47	A move that works differently for the Ghost type than for all other types.	OK?	Changed to flat percentage, but also is this imbalanced against bosses?
Cut	Normal	Physical	50	19	0	Cut deals damage with no additional effect in battle.	30	Yes	15	Single adjacent Pokémon	2	The target is cut with a scythe or claw.	OK	
Dark Pulse	Dark	Special	80	20	0	Dark Pulse deals damage and has a 20% chance (a d20 rolls 17 or higher) of causing the target to flinch.

This may also make the target flinch.	OK	
Dark Void	Dark	Status		10	0	Dark Void puts the target(s) to sleep. It can only be used by Darkrai. It targets all adjacent opponents. Each target is counted as a separate attack so it may succeed for all, any or none of the targets. Pokémon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit, or those behind a Substitute cannot be put to sleep.	10	No	66	All enemy Pokémon within view	1	Opposing Pokémon are dragged into a world of total darkness that makes them sleep.	OK

This Move cannot be used multiple times on the same target.	15	No	1	Single adjacent Pokémon (not self)	1	The user sharply raises the target’s Attack and Sp. Atk stats by decorating the target.	OK	I'm assuming this move can't be used on self or it would be pretty OP. Even now it's still kind of broken
Defend Order	Bug	Status			0	Defend Order raises the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage each.	10	No	40	Self	1	The user calls out its underlings to shield its body, raising its Defense and Sp. Def stats.	OK

OK	
Defog	Flying	Status			0	Defog lowers the target's Evasion by one stage and removes hazards and barriers around the user. The moves affected are: Light Screen, Reflect, Mist, Safeguard, Spikes, Stealth Rock, Sticky Web and Toxic Spikes. Defog also clears foggy weather in battle (which causes Accuracy loss when present).	15	No	35	All terrain in 50m radius	12	A strong wind blows away the target’s barriers such as Reflect or Light Screen. This also lowers the target’s evasiveness.	OK	
Destiny Bond	Ghost	Status		20	0	If the user faints before their next turn, the Pokémon who landed the knockout hit also faints. This Move's accuracy decreases by one stage after each successive use. If the user fainted because of indirect damage such as from Poison or Burn, no one else faints.	5	No	52	Self	24	After using this move, if the user faints, the Pokémon that landed the knockout hit also faints. Its chance of failing rises if it is used in succession.	OK	Clarified who faints and when
Detect	Normal	Status		20	4	Detect causes any attacks targeted at the user to have 0% accuracy, until the beginning of their next turn. It has priority +4 so will activate before most other moves. The move is similar to Protect, however, Protect takes the hit and negates damage, while Detect negates the attack's accuracy. The accuracy of Detect decreases by one stage each time it is used consecutively after itself or Protect, Endure, Wide Guard, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, King's Shield, or Baneful Bunker. Moves with infinite accuracy or under effects such as Mind Reader can still bypass Detect.	10	No	20	Self	71	This move enables the user to evade all attacks. Its chance of failing rises if it is used in succession.	OK	There are some subtle differences between Protect and Detect that I want to keep here because they seem interesting.

Dig	Ground	Physical	80	20	0	The user of Dig will burrow its way underground on the first turn, disappearing from view and becoming invulnerable to most attacks. On their next turn, the attack lands, the user moves adjacent to their target, and the turn concludes. While underground, the Pokémon can only be hit by the moves Earthquake, Magnitude or Fissure, with Earthquake and Magnitude dealing twice normal damage. Moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move can also hit for regular power. The user also avoids end-of-turn damage from Sandstorm and Hail when underground. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Dig executes in one turn. Dig can be used non-offensively to move to otherwise inaccessible areas during battle, in which case there is no attack roll.		Yes	1	Single Pokémon within move range	36	The user burrows into the ground, then attacks on the next turn.	OK	Clarified how movement happens during Dig, and specifically I want to avoid being able to do hit-and-runs where you escape afterwards. Added out-of-battle use guidance.
Disable	Normal	Status			0	Disable causes the previous move the target used to be disabled and unable to be used for 1d4 of their turns. If the move is currently in progress (such as Rollout or Sky Drop), it is not canceled.	20	No	12	Single Pokémon within 10m	35	For four turns, this move prevents the target from using the move it last used.	OK	Changed disable length to 1d4 turns.

Electric type Pokémon, those with the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute cannot be paralyzed.	15	No	40	All Pokémon within 10m	51	The user strikes everything around it by letting loose a flare of electricity. This may also cause paralysis.	OK	Changed to indiscriminate AOE
Dive	Water	Physical	80	20	0	Only usable in water. The user of Dive will hide underwater on the first turn, disappearing from view and becoming invulnerable to most attacks. On the second turn, Dive deals damage. While underwater, the Pokémon can only be hit by the moves Surf, Whirlpool or Low Kick, with Surf and Whirlpool dealing twice normal damage. Moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move can also hit for regular power. The user also avoids end-of-turn damage from Sandstorm and Hail when underwater. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Dive executes in one turn.	10	Yes	24	Single Pokémon within move range	7	Diving on the first turn, the user floats up and attacks on the next turn.

Double-Edge	Normal	Physical	120	20	0	Double-Edge deals damage, but the user receives 1/3 of the damage it inflicted (rounded down) in recoil. In other words, if the attack does 90 HP damage to the opponent, the user will lose 30 HP.	15	Yes	48	Single adjacent Pokémon	86	A reckless, life-risking tackle in which the user rushes the target. This also damages the user quite a lot.	OK	
Draco Meteor	Dragon	Special	130	18	0	Draco Meteor deals damage but lowers the user's Special Attack by two stages after attacking.	5	No	60	Single Pokémon within 20m	0	Comets are summoned down from the sky onto the target. The attack’s recoil harshly lowers the user’s Sp. Atk stat.	OK	
Dragon Ascent	Flying	Physical	120	20	0	Dragon Ascent deals damage but lowers the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage each after attacking. It is the signature move of Rayquaza, and once learned allows Rayquaza to Mega-Evolve.	5	Yes	1	Single Pokémon within move range	1	After soaring upward, the user attacks its target by dropping out of the sky at high speeds. But it lowers its own Defense and Sp. Def stats in the process.	OK

It also cancels Protect/Detect for the remainder of the turn, so subsequent moves in the same turn (in double/triple battles) can still hit.	10	No	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	25	This attack hits a target using a move such as Protect or Detect. This also lifts the effects of those moves.	OK	
Feint Attack	Dark	Physical	60	∞	0	Feint Attack deals damage and ignores changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats.

The faster Pokémon moves first but waits for the other Pokémon to make their move. When the slower Pledge user moves, the combo attack hits the Pokémon the slower user was targeting. If Fire Pledge is used with Grass Pledge, the move animation shows Fire Pledge and a sea of fire envelops the foe's team is created that damages opponents 1⁄8 of their maximum HP each turn, for 4 turns. If Fire Pledge is used with Water Pledge, the move animation shows Water Pledge and a rainbow appears in the sky on your team's side that doubles the chance of moves' secondary effects occurring for 4 turns.	10	No	40	Single adjacent Pokémon	0	A column of fire hits the target. When used with its grass equivalent, its power increases and a vast sea of fire appears.	Broken

In other words, the lower the user's HP, the higher the power.	15	Yes	20	Single adjacent Pokémon	61	The user flails about aimlessly to attack. The less HP the user has, the greater the move’s power.	OK?	The original move can theoretically go to 200 (?) power but I think 110 is more balanced for a level 20 attack
Flame Burst	Fire	Special	70	20	0	Flame Burst deals damage and will also cause splash damage to any Pokémon adjacent to the target (including the user if Flame Burst is targeted at an ally).	15	No	24	5m diameter circle within 10m	23	The user attacks the target with a bursting flame.

Flip Turn	Water	Agility	60	20	0	After making its attack, the user swaps places with an ally Pokémon within movement range	20	Yes	30	Single adjacent Pokémon	0		OK	Reinterpreted the swap out mechanic to be more like Ally Swap. Seems more interesting than just granting bonus movement
Floral Healing	Fairy	Status			0	The user restores the target's HP by up to half of its max HP. It restores 75% max HP when Grassy Terrain is active. The accuracy of Floral Healing lowers by 1 stage after each time it is used per battle, and cannot be undone by effects which would otherwise restore accuracy.	10	No	30	Single Ally Pokémon within 10m	1	The user restores the target’s HP by up to half of its max HP.

On their next turn, the attack lands, the user moves adjacent to their target, and the turn concludes. While in the air, the Pokémon can only be hit by the moves Gust, Twister, Thunder, Sky Uppercut and Smack Down, with Gust and Twister dealing twice normal damage. Moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move can also hit for regular power. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Fly executes in one turn. Fly can be used non-offensively to move to otherwise inaccessible areas during battle, in which case there is no attack roll.		Yes	1	Single Pokémon within move range	8	The user flies up into the sky and then strikes its target on the next turn.	OK	Clarified how movement happens during Fly, and specifically I want to avoid being able to do hit-and-runs where you escape afterwards. Added out-of-battle use guidance.

Focus Punch	Fighting	Physical	150	20	-3	The user of Focus Punch will tighten its focus and prepare a devastating punch. The punch does not strike until the beginning of the user's next turn. If any regular Move directly hits the focused Pokémon, it loses its focus does not carry out the attack. If no direct hits are made, Focus Punch attacks as normal.	20	Yes	52	Single adjacent Pokémon	11	The user focuses its mind before launching a punch. This move fails if the user is hit before it is used.	OK?	Simplified priority rules a bit, although now this seems too easy to disrupt. Make the flinch chance a 50% roll instead of happening on any incoming hit?
Follow Me	Normal	Status			2	All enemies of the user are unable to target a Pokémon other than the user for one full turn. They are not compelled to attack the user, but they cannot choose an alternative target either. Moves which target terrain, have an area of effect, or which already decided their target before Follow Me was used are unaffected. This Move has higher priority than most other Moves.	20	No	25	Self	6	The user draws attention to itself, making all targets take aim only at the user.	OK?

Frost Breath	Ice	Special	60	18	0	Frost Breath deals damage and always results in a critical hit, increasing its power to 90.

Guard Split	Psychic	Status			0	Guard Split averages the user's Defense and Special Defense with those of the target. Stat boosts are not taken into account. For example, if the user's Defense was 100, the opponent's was 200, and the opponent had used Screech on the user, then both Pokémon would end up with 150 Defense.

Pokémon with the ability Snow Cloak increase their evasion by 1 stage. Castform changes to Snowy Form.	10	No	42	Weather in 50m radius	19	The user summons a hailstorm lasting five turns. It damages all Pokémon except Ice types.	OK?	Replaced 1/16th HP damage with the usual 2d6. Since it's 50m radius there is also a chance to escape the storm. Also added accuracy debuff similar to Misty Terrain

OK?	any way to cure?

Ingrain cancels effects given to raised Pokémon such as immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes and so on.	20	No	15	Self	22	The user lays roots that restore its HP on every turn. Because it’s rooted, it can’t switch out.	OK?	reinterpreted "can't switch" to be "can't move" and made it cancelable at will. Does it heal on the turn it is used? What moves can force movement on an opponent? Circle Throw? Sky Drop?
Instruct	Psychic	Status			0	A Move which the user knows is executed by a teammate on this turn, using that teammate's stats, type, and current position. The Move must be one the user is currently able to perform (i.e. it is not Disabled, recharging, etc.). The teammate must not be fainted or in the middle of executing another Move, and they must also meet the Move's minimum level requirement. Effects which would normally happen to the user (such as recoil, stat decreases, or status effects) would instead happen to the teammate.	15	No	50	Single ally Pokémon within view	1	The user instructs the target to use the target’s last move again.

The effect goes away if either of the Pokémon leaves the field.	OK?	I want to make this one interesting but it's hard to balance. As it is now it feels like a regular Trap move like Bind, but worse

If the user is holding Light Clay when Light Screen is used, its effects last for 8 turns. Attacks originating from within the bubble are unaffected. Pokémon can freely move in and out of the bubble. The move Brick Break, when used against a Pokémon behind the Light Screen's effect, will remove the screen before dealing damage. The ability Infiltrator bypasses the effects of Light Screen. Light Screen is the Special counterpart to Reflect.	30	No	34	5m radius sphere around the user	38	A wondrous wall of light is put up to reduce damage from special attacks for five turns.	OK?	I considered having it be a personal force field around each ally, but it's more narratively interesting if it was like a Halo bubble shield

Me First cannot copy Sucker Punch or Fake Out, nor by its definition above any high priority move such as Extreme Speed. However it can copy a multi-turn move from any of its turns. The copied move's statistics are applied exactly as written except for the increased power. So, for example, the move's Type is as written and S.T.A.B. applies if the user matches that type.	20	No	42	Single non-ally Pokémon within view	19	The user cuts ahead of the target to copy and use the target’s intended move with greater power. This move fails if it isn’t used first.	OK

Meteor Assault	Fighting	Physical	150	20	0	User must recharge next turn.	5	No	70	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user attacks wildly with its thick leek. The user can’t move on the next turn, because the force of this move makes it stagger.	OK

Protect	Normal	Status		20	4	Protect negates the damage and inficted statuses of any attacks which strike the user, until the beginning of their next turn. It has priority +4 so will activate before most other moves. The move functions similarly to Detect, however, in the case of Protect the attack will still land and potentially trigger additional effects from the contact. The accuracy of Protect decreases by one stage each time it is used consecutively after itself or Detect, Endure, Wide Guard, Quick Guard, Spiky Shield, King's Shield, or Baneful Bunker.	10	No	20	Self	71	This move enables the user to protect itself from all attacks.

Psychic Terrain	Psychic	Status			0	Psychic Terrain creates a low-lying psychic field lasting 5 turns, that prevents high-priority moves (such as Quick Attack or Sucker Punch) from targeting grounded Pokémon. The power of Psychic type moves also increases while in effect. Grounded Pokémon are simply those that are not raised. Raised Pokémon are any Flying types or those under the effects of Levitate, Magnet Rise or Telekinesis.

The attack varies in intensity.	OK	this is nerfed a bit from the original

If the move succeeds, it also restores the user’s own HP.	OK	I assume this can target self
Pursuit	Dark	Physical	40	20	0	The user of Pursuit chases their target, moving a distance of up to 20m before making the attack (regardless of the user's speed).

Moves with priority 0 go down to -1. They can be initiated during the target's turn, but their effect does not happen until the beginning of their next turn. Moves in this category which already have an effect "at the beginning of the user's next turn" will get that effect immediately. Moves with a priority already below 0 are unaffected.	15	No	30	Single adjacent Pokémon	3	The user suppresses the target and makes its move go last.	OK?	This one can have a lot of edge cases...
Quick Attack	Normal	Agility	40	20	1	Quick Attack deals damage and has a priority of +1. Moves with a higher priority always go first, regardless of a Pokémon's speed.

This move always goes first.	OK

They are not compelled to attack the user, but they cannot choose an alternative target either.

This Move has higher priority than most other Moves.	20	No	78	Self	4	The user scatters a cloud of irritating powder to draw attention to itself. Opposing Pokémon aim only at the user.

Shadow Force	Ghost	Physical	120	20	0	The user of Shadow Force will vanish instantly on the first turn, disappearing from view and becoming invulnerable to most attacks. On the second turn, Shadow Force deals damage, the user moves adjacent to their target, and the turn ends. If the user is protected by a move such as Protect, Detect, Wide Guard, etc., that effect will be canceled before the damage is dealt. While disappeared, the Pokémon can only be hit by moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Shadow Force executes in one turn.	5	Yes	77	Single Pokémon within move range	2	The user disappears, then strikes the target on the next turn. This move hits even if the target protects itself.	OK	
Shadow Punch	Ghost	Physical	60		0	Shadow Punch deals damage and ignores changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats. However, it will not hit Pokémon during the invulnerable stage of Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force or Sky Drop.	20	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	7	The user throws a punch from the shadows.

Sheer Cold	Ice	Special	160	6	0	Sheer Cold has high power but its accuracy is very low.  This Move may not be used more than once in succession. If the user is not an Ice type, this Move's accuracy is 3.	5	No	56	Single adjacent Pokémon	21	The target faints instantly.

Signal Beam	Bug	Special	75	20	0	Signal Beam deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or higher) of confusing the target. Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo or those behind a Substitute cannot be confused.	15	No	29	Single Pokémon within 10m	21	The user attacks with a sinister beam of light. This may also confuse the target.	OK	
Silver Wind	Bug	Special	60	20	0	Silver Wind deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or higher) of raising the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed by one stage each.	5	No	23	Single Pokémon within 10m	14	The target is attacked with powdery scales blown by the wind. This may also raise all the user’s stats.	OK	
Simple Beam	Normal	Status			0	Simple Beam changes the target's ability to Simple. It does not cancel any ability's effects already felt (such as the Attack drop from Intimidate), but it does stop any further effects the ability may have (for example, damage from Rough Skin). It does not work on Pokémon with the abilities Truant or Multitype.	15	No	55	Single Pokémon within 10m	5	The user’s mysterious psychic wave changes the target’s Ability to Simple.	OK	
Sing	Normal	Status		11	0	Sing attempts to put all nearby Pokémon to sleep. Pokémon with the abilities Insomnia or Vital Spirit, or those behind a Substitute cannot be put to sleep.

If the user is holding a Power Herb, Skull Bash executes in one turn.	10	Yes	50	Single adjacent Pokémon	8	The user tucks in its head to raise its Defense stat on the first turn, then rams the target on the next turn.	OK?	For this and similar attacks, I want the user to be able to move and re-target on the second turn
Sky Attack	Flying	Physical	140	18	0	The user of Sky Attack will become cloaked in a harsh light on the first turn. On the second turn, Sky Attack selects a target, deals damage, and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of causing the target to flinch. The action on the second turn is used for the attack, but regular movement is retained. This Move also uses critical dice. If the user is holding a Power Herb, Sky Attack executes in one turn. Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch. Pokémon with the abilities Battle Armor or Shell Armor, or those under the effects of Lucky Chant, are protected against critical hits.	5	No	56	Targets any single Pokémon on the field including non-adjacent ones.	15	A second-turn attack move where critical hits land more easily. This may also make the target flinch.	OK	
Sky Drop	Flying	Agility	80	20	0	Sky Drop takes the target into the air on the first turn, then drops them on the second turn, wherein the target receives damage, both Pokémon move to a space within the user's move range, and the turn ends. While in the air, neither Pokémon can be hit, except by Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder or Twister. Moves from No Guard Pokémon, or any move following an identify move can also hit. Grabbed Pokémon lose movement on their turn but they may still use Moves on their attacker. Sky Drop will appear to work on Flying-types and those under the effects of Levitate, Magnet Rise or Telekinesis, but will not cause them any damage. It fails if Gravity is in effect, the target is holding an Iron Ball, or is behind a Substitute. If the move is interrupted (such as by the user Flinching) both Pokémon return to the ground and may suffer damage at the GM's discretion.	10	Yes	55	Single adjacent Pokémon	4	The user takes the target into the sky, then drops it during the next turn. The target cannot attack while in the sky.	OK	Changed so that the targeted Pokémon can still fight back in the air. Increased base power from 60 to 80 to balance this. Interrupting the attack also seems like it could have negative consequences, so I made that explicit in the description. Also changed to Agility attack.
Sky Uppercut	Fighting	Physical	85	18	0	Hits the opponent, even during Fly.	15	Yes	45	Single adjacent Pokémon	10	The user attacks the target with an uppercut thrown skyward with force.	OK

OK	
Sleep Talk	Normal	Status			0	The user performs one of its own moves while sleeping. The Move used is decided by a random dice roll.

Sludge	Poison	Special	65	20	0	Sludge deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of poisoning the target.

This may also poison those hit.	OK	
Smack Down	Rock	Physical	50	20	0	Smack Down deals damage and knocks the target to the ground, inflicting the Grounded status. Any raised Pokémon now become susceptible to Ground moves and Arena Trap. Raised Pokémon are any Flying types or those under the effects of Levitate, Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. Smack Down can hit Pokémon using Fly or Bounce and will bring them back down to the ground, thus cancelling the moves. It can also hit Pokémon using Sky Drop but does not knock them to the ground. It does not knock down Substitutes but deals damage to the Substitute as normal.		Yes	15	Single Pokémon within move range	23	The user throws a stone or similar projectile to attack the target. A flying Pokémon will fall to the ground when it’s hit.	OK	
Smart Strike	Steel	Physical	70	∞	0	The user stabs the target with a sharp horn. This attack never misses.	10	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user stabs the target with a sharp horn. This attack never misses.	OK

However, it also cures the paralysis.	10	Yes	30	Single adjacent Pokémon	2	This attack’s power is doubled when used on a target with paralysis. This also cures the target’s paralysis, however.	OK	
Smog	Poison	Special	30	14	0	Smog deals damage and has a 40% chance (a d20 rolls 13 or higher) of poisoning the target. Poison or Steel type Pokémon, those with the ability Immunity or those behind a Substitute cannot be poisoned.	20	No	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	14	The target is attacked with a discharge of filthy gases. This may also poison the target.	OK	
Smokescreen	Normal	Status	100	20	0	Smokescreen lowers the target's Accuracy by one stage. Pokémon with the abilities Keen Eye, Clear Body or White Smoke cannot have their accuracy reduced.	20	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	23	The user releases an obscuring cloud of smoke or ink. This lowers the target’s accuracy.	OK	
Snap Trap	Grass	Physical	35	20	0	Snap Trap inflicts damage immediately and then traps the opponent. See rules on "Trap Moves" for details.	15	Yes	45	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user snares the target in a snap trap for four to five turns.	OK	
Snarl	Dark	Special	55	19	0	Snarl deals damage and lowers the target's Special Attack by one stage.	15	No	9	Single Pokémon within 10m	8	The user yells as if it’s ranting about something, which lowers the Sp. Atk stats of opposing Pokémon.	OK	
Snatch	Dark	Status			4	Snatch is a priority move which can explicity be used as a reaction during the middle of another player's turn, and which steals the effects of the currently in-progress (if used as an reaction) or simply the next status move used by any opponent(s) until the user's next turn. If two or more Pokémon use Snatch, the slowest of the Pokémon will gain the effect, because the fastest Pokémon will steal the move first, then the next slowest will steal the move from the snatcher and so on. Moves that can be snatched: - Stat boosts, for example Swords Dance or Belly Drum (exceptions below) - Protection moves, for example Substitute, Lucky Chant, Wide Guard or Quick Guard (exceptions below) - Recovery and healing moves, for example Recover, Ingrain or Heal Bell - Imprison - Other self-induced effects such as Magnet Rise, Power Trick or Light Screen. Moves that cannot be snatched: Acupressure, Curse, Protect or Detect, Helping Hand, Taunt.	10	No	37	Self	15	The user steals the effects of any attempts to use a healing or stat-changing move.	OK?	This is a really tricky one to balance because of the "rock paper scissors under the table" that the video games had. If you have to declare you are using Snatch in advance, no one will want to heal (I suppose it's a discouragement tactic). However, if you can't interrupt other players' heals, then Snatch loses its use. This implementation favors the attacker more, but is balanced somewhat by them losing their action afterwards.
Snipe Shot	Water	Special	80	20	0	Ignores Moves and abilities that restrict targeting such as Spotlight. This Move uses critical dice	15	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	1	The user ignores the effects of opposing Pokémon’s moves and Abilities that draw in moves, allowing this move to hit the chosen target.	OK	
Snore	Normal	Special	50	20	0	Snore deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of causing the target to flinch. However, it can only be used while the user is asleep (either from a move like Hypnosis or self-induced via Rest). Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.	15	No	20	Single Pokémon within 10m	7	This attack can be used only if the user is asleep. The harsh noise may also make the target flinch.	OK

Soft-Boiled	Normal	Status			0	Soft-Boiled recovers up to 50% of the user's maximum HP.	10	No	44	Self	2	The user restores its own HP by up to half of its max HP.	OK	
Solar Beam	Grass	Special	120	20	0	The user of Solar Beam will absorb light on the first turn. On the second turn, Solar Beam selects a target and deals damage, which uses that turn's action (but not movement). During intense sunlight or when holding a Power Herb, Solar Beam executes in one turn. During rain, hail or a sandstorm its base power decreases by 50%.	10	No	48	Single adjacent Pokémon	22	In this two-turn attack, the user gathers light, then blasts a bundled beam on the next turn.	OK	Since turn order makes this move easily dodged, changed the targeting rules so that it can be aimed on the 2nd turn.
Solar Blade	Grass	Physical	125	20	0	The user of Solar Blade will absorb light on the first turn. On the second turn, the user selects a target and deals damage. Regular movement is retained on the 2nd turn. During intense sunlight or when holding a Power Herb, Solar Blade executes in one turn. During rain, hail or a sandstorm its power decreases by 50%.	10	Yes	63	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	In this two-turn attack, the user gathers light and fills a blade with the light’s energy, attacking the target on the next turn.	OK

Spacial Rend	Dragon	Special	100	19	0	Spacial Rend deals damage and uses critical dice.	5	No	80	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user tears the target along with the space around it. Critical hits land more easily.	OK	
Spark	Electric	Physical	65	20	0	Spark deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of paralyzing the target. Electric type Pokémon, those with the ability Limber or those behind a Substitute cannot be paralyzed.	20	Yes	20	Single adjacent Pokémon	26	The user throws an electrically charged tackle at the target. This may also leave the target with paralysis.	OK	
Sparkling Aria	Water	Special	90	20	0	All targets are cured of burns on hit, if they were afflicted by a burn	10	No	1	All enemy Pokémon within 10m	1	The user bursts into song, emitting many bubbles. Any Pokémon suffering from a burn will be healed by the touch of these bubbles.	OK

Spikes	Ground	Status			0	Spikes lays a trap of spikes on the ground, which inflict 3d6 damage on any Pokémon which cross over them. The spikes will not hit raised Pokémon. Raised Pokémon are any Flying types or those under the effects of Levitate, Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. Spikes can be cleared from the field using Defog or by a Flying-type move being used directly on them.	20	No	44	5m diameter circle within 10m	3	The user lays a trap of spikes at the opposing team’s feet. The trap hurts Pokémon that switch into battle.	OK?	
Spiky Shield	Grass	Status			4	Spiky Shield prevents any attacks targeted at the user from striking, until the beginning of the user's next turn. If a contact move is targeted at the Spiky Shield user on that turn, the attacker receives 4d6 damage. It has priority +4 so will activate before most other moves. Contact damage does not stack with the Rocky Helmet item or the Rough Skin or Iron Barbs abilities. The accuracy of Spiky Shield drops one stage each time it is used consecutively after itself or Protect, Detect, Endure, Wide Guard, Quick Guard, King's Shield, or Baneful Bunker.	10	No	60	Self	2	In addition to protecting the user from attacks, this move also damages any attacker that makes direct contact.	OK	is 4d6 damage too high?

OK?	can other effects like telekinesis still move the victim?
Spit Up	Normal	Special	-	20	0	Spit Up deals varying damage depending on how many times the user used Stockpile. The base power is 100, 200 or 300 if the user stockpiled one, two or three times respectively. Spit Up also removes the Defense and Special Defense boosts given through Stockpile.	10	No	16	Single adjacent Pokémon	14	The power stored using the move Stockpile is released at once in an attack. The more power is stored, the greater the move’s power.	OK	
Spite	Ghost	Status			0	The last Move used by the target is disabled for their next 1d4 turns	10	No	12	Single Pokémon within view	13	The user unleashes its grudge on the move last used by the target by cutting 4 PP from it.	OK	changed to be the same as Disable

OK	
Spotlight	Normal	Status			3	The user shines a spotlight on the target so that only the target may be attacked for this turn. All enemies of the target are unable to use Moves on a Pokémon other than the target until the beginning of the user's next turn. They are not compelled to attack the target, but they cannot choose an alternative target either. Moves which target terrain, have an area of effect, or which already decided their target before Spotlight was used are unaffected. This Move has higher priority than most other Moves.	15	No	1	Single Pokémon within view	6	The user shines a spotlight on the target so that only the target will be attacked during the turn.	OK?	Originally I believe Spotlight redirected existing attacks, but that seems unbalanced?
Stealth Rock	Rock	Status			0	Stealth Rock lays a trap of sharp levitating rocks, which inflict 3d6 damage on any Pokémon which attempt to pass through them. The rocks can be cleared from the field using Defog.	20	No	32	A 20m-long line within 30m	20	The user lays a trap of levitating stones around the opposing team. The trap hurts opposing Pokémon that switch into battle.	OK?	Changed it to be a wall of fire. Is 3d6 damage right?

The effect is cancelled if the raised Pokémon is hit by Smack Down, or if the user is made to Flinch or uses a different Move.

Terrain Pulse	Normal	Special	80	20	0	The user utilizes the power of the terrain to attack. This move’s type is determined by the terrain its user is standing on.	10	No	40	Single Pokémon within 10m	0		OK?	The terrain-specific rules are kind of left to the imagination...
Thief	Dark	Physical	60	20	0	Thief deals damage and steals the target's held item, if the user is not holding an item.

Thrash	Normal	Physical	120	20	0	The user of Thrash attacks for 3 turns (including this one), during which it loses its regular action (but not movement), and then becomes confused. A new target may be chosen for each attack. The user cannot cancel the move on their own. However, if Thrash is disrupted (e.g. if the move misses, the user flinches, the user cannot attack due to paralysis, or no more targets are within range) then it will stop and not cause confusion. Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo or those behind a Substitute cannot be confused.	10	Yes	48	Single adjacent Pokémon	50	The user rampages and attacks for two to three turns. The user then becomes confused.	OK

OK	
Torment	Dark	Status			0	The target cannot use the same move twice in a row until they resolve the Tormented status effect.

OK?	Changed to be a regular status effect except with a higher DC

The affected Pokémon will take 2d6 poison damage at the end of the first turn, which then increases by 2d6 each turn. In other words, the damage is 2d6, 4d6, 6d6, and so on. Toxic doesn't affect Pokémon already affected by a major status ailment, Pokémon behind a Substitute nor Poison- or Steel-type Pokémon.	10	No	36	Single adjacent Pokémon	47	A move that leaves the target badly poisoned. Its poison damage worsens every turn.	OK?	Is this balanced? With poison-curing items it should be fine, but otherwise it's almost certain death
Toxic Spikes	Poison	Status			0	Toxic Spikes lays a trap of poisonous spikes on the ground, which poison Pokémon which cross over them. The spikes will not poison any raised Pokémon, nor does it affect Poison or Steel types, nor Pokémon with the abilities Immunity or Magic Guard. Raised Pokémon are any Flying types or those under the effects of Levitate, Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. Toxic Spikes can be cleared from the field using Defog or by a Flying-type move being used directly on them. Poison type Pokémon (that are not raised) will also absorb the spikes, removing them from the field.	20	No	20	5m diameter circle within 10m	17	The user lays a trap of poison spikes at the feet of the opposing team.

The transformation lasts for as long as the user wishes, or until they are Fainted.	10	No	80	Single Pokémon with view	2	The user transforms into a copy of the target right down to having the same move set.	OK?	This one seems potentially overpowered but could also have a lot of interesting narrative use so I want to make it viable. Enforcing the move level requirement nerfs it a bit (so you can't just Transform into the boss and then use their uber moves).
Tri Attack	Normal	Special	80	20	0	Tri Attack deals damage and has a 20% chance of paralyzing, burning or freezing the target. Roll a d20 and apply a status effect if it is 17 or higher.

Trick Room	Psychic	Status			-7	The turn order for the battle is instantly reversed. Combatants which enter the battle after Trick Room is used will be inserted into the order as usual.	5	No	70	Targets the entire field.	3	The user creates a bizarre area in which slower Pokémon get to move first for five turns.	OK?	This one is kind of meta but I like it. It could mess with everyone's brains trying to figure out "how many turns have passed" for things like weather effects and recharges though...
Trick-or-Treat	Ghost	Status	100	20	0	Trick-or-Treat adds the Ghost type to the target. If the target is dual-typed they essentially become a triple-typed Pokémon. It fails if one of the Pokémon's types is already Ghost.

Trop Kick	Grass	Physical	70	20	0	Trop Kick deals damage and lowers the target's Attack by one stage.	15	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	The user lands an intense kick of tropical origins on the target. This also lowers the target’s Attack stat.	OK	
Trump Card	Normal	Special	-	-	0	The user of this move chooses its power on each use. Accuracy decreases inversely to power level. The base power and accuracy start at 20/20. For every +20 increase in power, the accuracy decreases by 3. So you can choose 20/20, 40/17, 60/14, 80/11, 100/8, 120/5, or 140/2.	5	Yes	45	Single adjacent Pokémon	4	The fewer PP this move has, the greater its power.	OK?

Twineedle	Bug	Physical	25	20	0	Twineedle deals damage and will strike twice (with 25 base power each time). It has a 20% chance (a d20 rolls 17 or higher) of poisoning the target on each hit. Poison or Steel type Pokémon, those with the ability Immunity or those behind a Substitute cannot be poisoned. See rules on "Multi-Hit Moves" for more details.	20	No	13	One or two adjacent Pokémon	3	The user damages the target twice in succession by jabbing it with two spikes. This may also poison the target.	OK	
Twister	Dragon	Special	40	20	0	Twister deals damage and has a 30% chance (a d20 rolls 15 or higher) of causing the target to flinch. Pokémon with the ability Inner Focus or those behind a Substitute cannot be made to flinch.

Uproar	Normal	Special	90	20	0	For this and the user's next 2 turns, they inflict damage on a single adjacent target. The user must declare and lock in their next target at the end of each turn. Regular movement is allowed during these turns. If no targets are available, the Move still continues but deals no damage. During this time, no Pokémon on the field will be able to sleep, and any sleeping Pokémon will be woken up. Once started, the user cannot cancel the attack on their own.	10	No	36	Single adjacent Pokémon	35	The user attacks in an uproar for three turns. During that time, no Pokémon can fall asleep.	OK?	Nerfed a bit (similar to Rollout) by forcing the next target to be declared in advance so they can react to it.
V-create	Fire	Physical	180	19	0	V-create deals damage but lowers the user's Defense, Special Defense and Speed by one stage each after attacking.	5	Yes	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	1	With a hot flame on its forehead, the user hurls itself at its target. This lowers the user’s Defense, Sp. Def, and Speed stats.	OK	
Vacuum Wave	Fighting	Special	40	20	1	Vacuum Wave deals damage and has a priority of +1. Moves with a higher priority always go first, regardless of a Pokémon's speed. If two moves with the same priority are used, the faster Pokémon goes first as usual.	30	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	2	The user whirls its fists to send a wave of pure vacuum at the target. This move always goes first.	OK	
Venom Drench	Poison	Status	100	20	0	If the target is poisoned, Venom Drench lowers its Attack, Special Attack and Speed by one stage each.	20	No	42	All opponent Pokémon within reach	14	Opposing Pokémon are drenched in an odd poisonous liquid.

Vital Throw	Fighting	Physical	70		-1	Vital Throw grabs an opponent and deals damage at the beginning of the attacker's next turn. Vital Throw ignores changes to the Accuracy and Evasion stats. However, it cannot target Pokémon who are Rooted or during the invulnerable stage of Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force or Sky Drop. Pokémon who are grabbed lose their movement on their turn and cannot initiate the Moves listed above, but they may use other Moves.	10	Yes	24	Single adjacent Pokémon	8	The user attacks last. In return, this throw move never misses.	OK?	It feels like this one may have more edge cases.
Volt Switch	Electric	Special	70	20	0	After making its attack, the user swaps places with an ally Pokémon within movement range	20	No	31	Single adjacent Pokémon	10	After making its attack, the user rushes back to switch places with a party Pokémon in waiting.	OK	copied from Flip Turn / U-Turn
Volt Tackle	Electric	Physical	120	20	0	Volt Tackle deals damage and has a 10% chance (a d20 rolls 19 or higher) of paralyzing the target, but the user receives one third of the damage it inflicted in recoil. In other words, if the attack does 90 HP damage to the opponent, the user will lose 30 HP.	15	Yes	20	Single adjacent Pokémon	0	The user electrifies itself and charges the target. This also damages the user quite a lot. This attack may leave the target with paralysis.	OK	
Wake-Up Slap	Fighting	Physical	70	20	0	Wake-Up Slap deals damage, and hits with double power (140) if the target is asleep. However, it also wakes up the target.	10	Yes	29	Single adjacent Pokémon	22	This attack inflicts big damage on a sleeping target. This also wakes the target up, however.	OK	
Water Gun	Water	Special	40	20	0	Water Gun deals damage with no additional effect.	25	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	97	The target is blasted with a forceful shot of water.	OK	
Water Pledge	Water	Special	80	20	0	Water Pledge deals damage at base power 80. If a teammate uses Grass Pledge or Fire Pledge in the same turn, the moves combine into one attack of base power 160 and added effects appear. The faster Pokémon moves first but waits for the other Pokémon to make their move. When the slower Pledge user moves, the combo attack hits the Pokémon the slower user was targeting. If Water Pledge is used with Grass Pledge, the move animation shows Grass Pledge and a swamp envelops the foe's team that halves the opponents' speed for 4 turns. If Water Pledge is used with Fire Pledge, the move animation shows Water Pledge and a rainbow appears in the sky on your team's side that doubles the chance of moves' secondary effects occurring for 4 turns.	10	No	50	Single adjacent Pokémon	0	A column of water hits the target. When used with its fire equivalent, its power increases and a rainbow appears.	Broken	
Water Pulse	Water	Special	60	20	0	Water Pulse deals damage and has a 20% chance (a d20 rolls 17 or higher) of confusing the target. Pokémon with the ability Own Tempo or those behind a Substitute cannot be confused.	20	No	16	Single Pokémon within 10m	50	The user attacks the target with a pulsing blast of water. This may also confuse the target.	OK	
Water Shuriken	Water	Special	15	20	1	Water Shuriken hits 1d4 + 1 times and attacks with increased priority. See rules for "Multi-Hit Moves" for more details.	20	No	1	Single Pokémon within 10m	1	The user hits the target with throwing stars two to five times in a row. This move always goes first.	OK	
Water Sport	Water	Status			0	The user soaks the battlefield with water. Water Sport reduces the power of Fire-type moves by 50%. The effect applies to the entire field. Most Pokémon that learn Water Sport are part Water type and thus already resistant to Fire attacks.	15	No	3	All terrain within 50m	48	This weakens Fire-type moves for five turns.	OK?	
Water Spout	Water	Special	-	20	0	Water Spout has a base power equal to the user's current HP, to a maximum of 150. Water Spout is a counterpart move to Eruption. It is also similar to Crush Grip and Wring Out, based on the user rather than the opponent.	5	No	54	All Pokémon within 10m	5	The user spouts water to damage opposing Pokémon. The lower the user’s HP, the lower the move’s power.	OK?	changed to indiscriminate AOE similar to Eruption

Weather Ball	Normal	Special	50	20	0	The power and type of Weather Ball changes with the weather. With no weather condition it is Normal and has a base power of 50. If a weather condition is in effect, its power increases to 100 and the move becomes a different type: Bright sunlight = Fire type, Heavy rain = Water type, Sandstorm = Rock type, Hailstorm = Ice type, Fog = stays Normal type (but power still doubles). Weather Ball will receive STAB where appropriate - for example by Vanilluxe during a hailstorm, or Castform during sun, rain or hail since it transforms into the appropriate type. In sun and rain, the power of Weather Ball will gain an additional +50 power because Fire- and Water-type moves are boosted respectively in those conditions. (Other weather conditions don't receive any type boost.)	10	No	1	Single adjacent Pokémon	6	This attack move varies in power and type depending on the weather.	OK	
Whirlpool	Water	Special	35	17	0	Whirlpool inflicts damage immediately and then traps the opponent in a vortex. See rules on "Trap Moves" for details. In addition, if the affected Pokémon is underwater because of Dive, this move's base power is doubled.	15	No	27	Single adjacent Pokémon	9	The user traps the target in a violent swirling whirlpool for four to five turns.	OK?	
Whirlwind	Normal	Status			0	Whirlwind blows the target Pokémon away up to 20m, at the user's direction. Pokémon with the ability Suction Cups or those rooted by Ingrain are not affected by Whirlwind.	20	No	25	Single Pokémon within 10m	13	The target is blown away, and a different Pokémon is dragged out. In the wild, this ends a battle against a single Pokémon.	OK

Wide Guard	Rock	Status			3	Wide Guard protects nearby allies from all damage, until the beginning of the user's next turn. It has priority +3 so will activate before most other moves. The accuracy of Wide Guard does not decrease if used consecutively after itself or Quick Guard. However, it does decrease the accuracy of Protect, Detect, Endure, Spiky Shield, King's Shield and Baneful Bunker by one stage each time it or Quick Guard is used.	10	No	18	All ally Pokémon within 5m	25	The user and its allies are protected from wide-ranging attacks for one turn.	OK	Reinterpreted so it's basically Protect but with an AOE range so it can protect nearby allies. Is it balanced to block multiple attacks?
Wild Charge	Electric	Physical	90	20	0	Wild Charge deals damage, but the user receives 25% of the damage it inflicted in recoil. In other words, if the attack does 100 HP damage to the opponent, the user will lose 25 HP.	15	Yes	55	Single adjacent Pokémon	11	The user shrouds itself in electricity and smashes into its target. This also damages the user a little.	OK	
Will-O-Wisp	Fire	Status	85	17	0	Will-O-Wisp causes the target to become burned, if it hits. Fire type Pokémon, those with the ability Water Veil or those behind a Substitute cannot be burned.	15	No	20	Single adjacent Pokémon	15	The user shoots a sinister flame at the target to inflict a burn.	OK

Wish	Normal	Status		20	0	At the beginning of their next turn, the target recovers HP up to 50% of their max HP. The accuracy of Wish decreases by one stage after each time it is used. This decrease cannot be undone by effects which would normally restore accuracy.	10	No	30	Self or ally Pokémon within 10m	10	One turn after this move is used, the user’s or its replacement’s HP is restored by half the user’s max HP.	OK	Changed to allow healing of nearby allies since healing moves are rare

Wood Hammer	Grass	Physical	120	20	0	Wood Hammer deals damage, but the user receives one-third of the damage it inflicted in recoil. In other words, if the attack does 90 HP damage to the opponent, the user will lose 30 HP.	15	Yes	41	Single adjacent Pokémon	12	The user slams its rugged body into the target to attack. This also damages the user quite a lot.	OK	
Work Up	Normal	Status			0	Work Up raises the user's Attack and Special Attack by one stage each.	30	No	16	Self	23	The user is roused, and its Attack and Sp. Atk stats increase.	OK

Wring Out	Normal	Special	-	20	0	Wring Out has a base power equal to the opponent's current HP, to a maximum of 110. Wring Out is a Special-category counterpart move to Crush Grip. It is also similar to Water Spout and Eruption, based on the opponent rather than the user.	5	Yes	49	Single adjacent Pokémon	30	The user powerfully wrings the target. The more HP the target has, the greater the move’s power.	OK?	
X-Scissor	Bug	Agility	80	20	0	The user slashes at the target by crossing its scythes or claws as if they were a pair of scissors.	15	Yes	36	Single adjacent Pokémon	23	The user slashes at the target by crossing its scythes or claws as if they were a pair of scissors.	OK
